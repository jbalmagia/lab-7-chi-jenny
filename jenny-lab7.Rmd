This: I am Jenny and I am updating this Markdown file here. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

gc_df <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")
```
We are asking: is there a significant difference in recommended gun control action for male and female respondents (should guns be easier, harder, or the same difficulty to get?)


Now I (Kyle Monper aka Moo) am adding text:

Jenny: Data wrangling and counts

```{r}
get_guns <- gc_df %>% 
  filter(gender != "NA", make_get_guns != "NA") %>% 
  count(gender, make_get_guns)
```
